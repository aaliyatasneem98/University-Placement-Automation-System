# University-Placement-Automation-System

<h2><b>ABSTRACT</b></h2>
<p>Training & Placement (TAP) cell is the bridge between students and companies visiting the campus for recruitment so all the data and activities of TAP cell are important. Our Project “University Campus Placement Automation System” aims at reducing human efforts and errors caused manually by automating important tasks of TAP cell.</h4>

To achieve this automation system, we have created a web application which have two different login portals each for the Students (final year), and Companies (HRs or Employers) visiting the campus. Students will enter all their personal as well as professional details while registering themselves into the system. The Companies will register with their company name, Job title, No. of vacancy, Job description, Job profile, Criteria. The students can view and apply to the companies. The companies can view the list of student profile who have applied to the particular company. The admin of the system, has the access to all the portal. He manages the whole system.</p>

This Project “University Campus Placement Automation System” can help the placement officers with great ease by automating the placement related activities of the universities without any difficulty. Any information related to colleges regarding the placement drives can be got in just one mouse click. The user interface would be simple and easy to understand. And this will make the whole placement process run smooth while saving a lot of time.</p>


<h2><b>Objective of System</b></h2>
<p>This projects aims to automate all the placement related activities of the college or universities without any difficulty. Any information related to the placement drives, job fairs, interviews round etc will be received in just one mouse click. It helps to manage the college related informations to be secured in a more secure way.</p>

<h2><b>Proposed Work</b></h2>
<p>Our proposed system will work as one stop solution for all existing issues. All the tasks that are important and need to be performed efficiently are included in web application. Our system basically not only focuses on providing student eligibility list and calculation of data but also on providing students with all the materials needed for preparation at a single point. Role based access rights are provided to each user and each user has its own login tab where he/she can manage own personal information and all the work or content provided by the adjourned faculty. To prevent application from any kind of crashing cloud is used and all the data will be stored on cloud so that it can be accessed 24*7 from anywhere. 
<br>
<br>
Our system also makes sure that the user interface is user friendly so that neither the students nor the faculty has any problem understanding the concept of web application and has no complaint with navigation. The pages are linked in most suitable manner making it easy to jump from one page to another flawlessly. The proposed system is intended to avoid all the drawbacks of the existing system. It will add some more features than the existent system.
<br>
<br>
The proposed system is cost effective way of doing the manual process done in the existing system. This helps the organization to win the war in existing competitive world. The proposed system is college specific web application having access to entire college database which in turn will let TPO, student and HR communicate properly. Student id given to students is used as way to see the details and be updated
with all upcoming events in the college. Also help the faculty with a system that will count the number of papers checked per day and reduce the efforts of entering the details manually.</p>


<h2><b>Proposed Enhancements</b></h2>
<p>The system is designed after taking into consideration all the requirements of students and Placement and Training department but there can be improvements in some areas and we accept the drawbacks of our system. The system can be extended further to provide a forum for discussion where the alumni students and current students can discuss the events. In proposed Online Campus Placement System, it’s not providing the notifications of events. Hence, it can be modified and we can use APIs to get the email or SMS notifications as well. Apart from these in the future we can place the system on the cloud so the maintenance of the data can be reduced.
<br>
<br>
We can even add a feature “Placement Prediction” where a student can predict his/her placement chances on the basis of his/her skills, experiences and aggregated CGPA, we can do this with the use of K-means Clustering - a machine learning algorithm. The Exam system will integrate with the online placement system so the student result can get directly. We can also merge or link the ERP system into the automated campus placement system which in return will help the faculties by reducing their workloads. Combining these two systems will help in double verification of marks and other important details.</p>
